The project shows list of data in tableview with search feature on the basis of titles texts. The application supports offline data load as well.
The data in the tableview is loaded using the lazy loading concept with chunk of 20 data at a time. while data keeps loading on scroll of tableview.
On the detail screen it shows corresponding detail of selected tableview cell. Currently the images are not getting loaded (may be the image is in protected folder) hence loading dummy image.
Added code for image download as well as write image to document directory for offline support.
